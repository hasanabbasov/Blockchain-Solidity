# **SMART CONTRACT PROJECT**

## 1. INTRODUCTION

   Today, we would like to talk to you about one of the most impressive technologies of recent times, blockchain, and an application based on Ethereum, one of the leading actors of this technology. As the value and usage areas of Ethereum increase, applications that can work integrated with Ethereum are gaining more and more importance. Letâ€™s look at the brief information about Blockchain technology and Ethereum.
### 1.1 BLOCKCHAIN
   Blockchain technology is a decentralized and transparent system that allows multiple parties to securely record and verify transactions in a tamper-proof manner. At its core, a blockchain is a digital ledger or database that stores information in blocks, which are linked together in a chronological and immutable chain.
   Brief explanation of how blockchain technology works: 
- ###  1.1.1. Distributed Network:
  Instead of being stored on a single central server, the blockchain is distributed across a network of computers, known as nodes. Each node maintains a copy of the entire blockchain, ensuring redundancy and increasing security.
- ### 1.1.2. Blocks
  Transactions are grouped into blocks,which contain a set of data, such as transaction details, timestamps, and a unique identifier called a hash. Each block also includes the hash of the previous block, creating a chain-like structure.
- ### 1.1.3. Consensus Mechanism
  To add a new block to the blockchain, the network's participants must agree on its validity. Various consensus mechanisms, such as proof-of-work (PoW) or proof-of-stake (PoS), are used to ensure agreement among the nodes and prevent malicious activities.
- ### 1.1.4. Security and Immutability
  Once a block is added to the blockchain, it becomes extremely difficult to alter or remove. The blocks are secured through cryptographic hashing, which means any change in the block's data would result in a different hash. As each block's hash is included in the subsequent block, tampering with one block would require altering the entire chain, making it highly impractical.
- ### 1.1.5. Transparency and Privacy
  While the content of transactions is typically visible on the blockchain, the participants' identities may remain pseudonymous. Public blockchains allow anyone to view and verify transactions, promoting transparency. However, private blockchains can restrict access to authorized participants, providing additional privacy.
    Blockchain technology has gained significant attention due to its potential applications beyond cryptocurrencies. It can be used for various purposes, such as supply chain management, digital identity verification, smart contracts, decentralized finance (DeFi), voting systems, and more. The immutability, transparency, and security offered by blockchain make it an appealing solution for industries seeking to streamline processes, increase trust, and reduce reliance on intermediaries.
### 1.2 ETHEREUM
Ethereum is an open-source blockchain platform that enables the development and execution of decentralized applications and smart contracts. It was proposed by Vitalik Buterin in 2013 and launched in 2015. While Bitcoin primarily serves as a digital currency, Ethereum extends the functionality of blockchain technology to enable programmable transactions and the creation of decentralized applications.

_Ethereum's key features:_

- ### 1.2.1. Smart Contracts
  Ethereum introduced the concept of smart contracts, which are self-executing agreements with the terms of the contract directly written into the code. These contracts automatically execute when predefined conditions are met, removing the need for intermediaries, and enhancing efficiency in various domains, including finance, supply chain management, gaming, and more.
- ###  1.2.2. Ether (ETH)
  Ether is the native cryptocurrency of the Ethereum platform. It serves as a fuel for executing smart contracts and powering decentralized applications. Participants in the Ethereum network can use ether for transactions, computational services, or as a store of value.
- ### 1.2.3. Decentralized Applications
  Ethereum provides a platform for developers to build and deploy decentralized apps. These applications can leverage the blockchain's decentralized and distributed nature to offer enhanced security, transparency, and user control. Examples of dApps include decentralized exchanges, prediction markets, decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms, and more.
- ### 1.2.4. EthereumVirtualMachine(EVM)
  The EVM is a runtime environment that executes smart contracts on the Ethereum network. It enables developers to write code in various programming languages, such as Solidity, and deploy it on the Ethereum blockchain. The EVM ensures the consistent execution of smart contracts across all network nodes.
  1.2.5. Gas: Gas is a unit used to measure the computational effort required to execute transactions and smart contracts on the Ethereum network. Each operation on the network consumes a specific amount of gas, and participants must pay for gas using ether. Gas fees incentivize efficient use of network resources and prioritize transactions based on their associated fees.
  1.2.6. Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs): EIPs are proposals for technical improvements and new features in the Ethereum ecosystem. They allow community members to contribute ideas and shape the future development of the platform.
  Ethereum's flexibility, programmability, and active developer community have made it a leading platform for blockchain-based innovation. It has fueled the growth of decentralized finance, non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and various other applications that rely on the transparent and trustless nature of blockchain technology.

## CODE EXPLANATION
- ### 4.1. Client
  Client side is the frontend part of the project made by using react and vite. There are components and hooks that can handle creating, submitting, and displaying an Ethereum transaction.
-
  **TransactionCard component:** Displays each Ethereum transaction on a separate card. Each card shows the address the transaction was sent to, the address the transaction was sent to, the amount, a possible message, and the timestamp of the transaction. There is also a link showing the corresponding process at etherscan.io.
-
  **Transaction component:** Displays each Ethereum transaction on a separate card. Each card shows the address the transaction was sent to, the address the transaction was sent to, the amount, a possible message, and the timestamp of the transaction. There is also a link showing the corresponding process at etherscan.io.
- 
  **TransactionContext:** This is a React Context for storing and sharing transactions and other related data. This includes transactions, wallet address and form data as well as several functions.
- 
  **TransactionsProvider component:** This is the parent component that provides data to the child components. The useEffect hook checks if the
  wallet is connected when the page loads and gets the current transactions.

- ### 4.2. Solidity
 - **addToBlockchain():** The addToBlockchain function is a public function within the Solidity smart contract. Its purpose is to add a new transaction to the blockchain by storing the transaction details in the transactions array.
1. The function takes four parameters:
   - 1. **receiver:** The address of the transaction receiver (payable).
   - 2. **amount:** The amount of the transaction.
   - 3. **message:** A string representing an optional message associated with the transaction.
   - 4. **keyword:** A string representing an optional keyword associated with the transaction.
   
2. **Transaction Count:** The transactionCount variable is incremented by one, indicating that a new transaction is being added to the blockchain.
3. **Transaction Storage:** The details of the new transaction are stored in the transactions array. A new TransferStruct struct is created with the values:

  - 1.  â€¢ **msg.sender:** The address of the transaction sender.

  - 2. â€¢ **receiver:** The address of the transaction receiver.

  - 3. â€¢ **amount:** The amount of the transaction.

  - 4. â€¢ **message:** The optional message associated with the transaction.

  - 5. â€¢ **block.timestamp:** The timestamp representing the block when the transaction is added.

  - 6. â€¢ **keyword:** The optional keyword associated with the transaction. The TransferStruct object is then pushed into the transactions array.

4. **Event Emission:** The Transfer event is emitted to notify listeners about the occurrence of a new transaction. It includes the same values as the TransferStruct fields: msg.sender, receiver, amount, message, block.timestamp, and keyword. The event serves as a way to log the transaction and provide an event-driven mechanism for external systems to respond to new transactions on the blockchain.

In summary, the addToBlockchain function increments the transaction count, stores the transaction details in the transactions array, and emits the Transfer event to record and notify the addition of a new transaction to the blockchain.

**getAllTransactions() & getTransactionCount():** These methods are both public view functions within the Solidity smart contract. These functions provide read-only access to the transaction data stored in the contract without modifying the contract state. Here's an explanation of what each method does:
1. **getAllTransactions():**

    â€¢ **Return Type:** The function returns an array of TransferStruct structures representing all the transactions stored in the contract.

    â€¢ **Purpose:** This function allows external callers to retrieve all the
    transactions recorded in the contract.

    â€¢ **Implementation:** It simply returns the transactions array, which
    contains all the stored transaction details.

2. **getTransactionCount():**

    â€¢ **Return Type:** The function returns an unsigned integer (uint256) representing the total count of transactions stored in the contract.

    â€¢ **Purpose:** This function provides the ability to query the total number of transactions recorded in the contract.

    â€¢ **Implementation:** It returns the value of the transactionCount variable, which keeps track of the total count of transactions. This variable is incremented each time a new transaction is added to the blockchain using the addToBlockchain function.

In summary, the getAllTransactions function allows for retrieving an array of all the transactions stored in the contract, while the getTransactionCount function provides the count of total transactions stored in the contract. These methods enable users or other contracts to
access and query the transaction data in a read-only manner without altering the contract state.

**getTransactionsBySender():** The getTransactionsBySender method is a public view function within the Solidity smart contract. It allows users to retrieve an array of TransferStruct transactions associated with a specific sender address. Here's an explanation of what the method does:
1. **Parameter:** The function takes a single parameter, sender, which represents the address of the sender for whom the transactions need to be retrieved.
2. **Counting Matches:** The method iterates through the transactions array to count the number of transactions where the sender matches the provided address. It initializes a local variable count to 0 and loops through each transaction in the array. If the sender of a transaction matches the provided sender address, the count is incremented.
3. **Transaction Array Initialization:** After counting the matches, the method initializes a dynamic array senderTransactions of type TransferStruct[] with a length equal to the count value. This array will store the transactions associated with the given sender.
4. **Populating Matched Transactions:** The method iterates through the transactions array again to find transactions where the sender matches the provided address. It uses a separate index j to keep track of the position in the senderTransactions array.
- If the sender of a transaction matches the provided sender address, the current transaction is assigned to senderTransactions[j], and j is incremented.
- This process ensures that only the transactions associated with the given sender are copied to the senderTransactions array.
5. **Returning the Result:** Finally, the method returns the senderTransactions array, which contains all the matched transactions associated with the provided sender address.

In summary, the getTransactionsBySender method allows users to fetch an array of transactions associated with a specific sender address. It counts the matching transactions, initializes a new array, copies the matching transactions to the new array, and returns it as the result. This function provides a convenient way to retrieve specific transactions based on the sender's address.
